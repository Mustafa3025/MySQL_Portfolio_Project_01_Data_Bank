**MySQL Portfolio Project: Data Bank**

Welcome to the MySQL Portfolio Project: Data Bank repository! This project was developed as part of the curriculum provided by Atomcamp, a program designed to prepare individuals for careers in data science. Here, we explore a fictional digital bank called Data Bank, which integrates banking services with secure distributed data storage.

### Introduction

Data Bank is a groundbreaking initiative in the financial industry, spearheaded by Danny and his team. By blending the characteristics of neo-banks with innovative data storage solutions, Data Bank aims to revolutionize the way customers manage their finances while ensuring the highest level of data security.

### Available Data

In this repository, you'll find three main tables:

1. **Regions**: Provides information about the different regions where Data Bank operates.
2. **Customer Nodes**: Stores data on customer allocations across nodes based on regions.
3. **Customer Transactions**: Records all customer transactions, including deposits, withdrawals, and purchases.

### Case Study Questions

The project is structured around four main sections:

**A. Customer Nodes Exploration**: Investigates various aspects of customer node distribution.

**B. Customer Transactions**: Analyzes customer transaction data to derive insights into deposit behavior, monthly activities, and closing balances.

**C. Data Allocation Challenge**: Proposes three different data allocation options and requires generating data elements to estimate data provisioning needs for each option.

**D. Extra Challenge**: Introduces a more complex scenario involving interest-based data allocation, challenging the calculation of data growth on a daily basis.
